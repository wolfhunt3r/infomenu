So... I've been wanting to get into programming for a few years now. Over the course of those years I've come to the conclusion that Python is what I want to start with. 
Since I don't want to write a lot of code I will never use (outside of training / following guides) I decided to code a simple program that you can start and that displays a menu with some basic choices. Amongst these, showing the computers:

* IP-adress, on the LAN and externally.
* MAC ID of LAN interface
* Used and available space on connected drives
* What user was last logged in

...etc. More to come I guess.

Since I am just starting my programming journey I think this will be hard enough.
